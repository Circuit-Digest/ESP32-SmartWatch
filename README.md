Smartwatches give individuals lightweight and quick access to messages, warnings, health data and other advanced information while in a hurry. While officially ground-breaking as independent gadgets, the capabilities of smartwatches increment essentially when utilized paired with different gadgets that individuals convey, for example, their smartphones or tablets. In this project, we are going to build such a feature-rich, customizable smartwatch from scratch. We are going to make this using the best affordable and easily available components. Since designing such a product is a lengthy time-consuming procedure, we are going to do them in parts.
